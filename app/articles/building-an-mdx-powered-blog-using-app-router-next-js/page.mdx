Having an MDX powered blog is frickin' crazy y'all! I can import components directly into my article! ðŸ˜²

### The problem with my old site

My old site was powered by contentful CMS backend, and it was so unintuitive for me to include code snippets or create content on the fly.

Contentful doesn't support embedded code snippets, so I had to create a custom post type with a single textarea field that I would paste code into and then go back and include it in the associated blog post.

It worked, but it made documenting a process or sharing a code snippet really inconvenient. It honestly took all the fun out of writing about tech, but this is a total game changer! ðŸ¤¯

In this article I will document how I built an MDX powered blog using App Router. Check out the code for this website [here](https://github.com/anthonycoffey/coffey.codes)

### What is MDX?

MDX is a file format that lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown. It's pretty cool, and it's what I'm using to write this article.

### This is the way

Now I have an easy way to quickly write articles with code snippets and images. I can even import components directly into my article! (I did say that already, lol... I'm pretty excited about it though!

### How I did it

Coming soon!

## Counter Component Example

This is arbitrary, but a cool demonstration of my new blogging method! ðŸ˜Ž I can import components directly into my article, I'm going to scream it out into the streets of South Austin! ðŸ˜‚

```javascript
"use client"; // this is required for the embedded component to work within the .mdx file
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function CounterComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState < number > 0;

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-8">
      <div className="bg-white rounded-lg p-8 shadow-lg">
        <span className="font-bold mb-4 block text-center">
          Counter Example
        </span>
        <div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
          <button
            className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-blue-300"
            onClick={incrementCount}
          >
            Increment
          </button>
          <span className="text-xl font-semibold p-2 border border-2 rounded">
            {count}
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
