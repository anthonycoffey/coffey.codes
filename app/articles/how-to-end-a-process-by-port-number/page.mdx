Have you ever tried to start a service and then discover that something is already running on that port, but you aren't sure what?

You might have saw an error like `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5000` and wondered what to do next.

Well then I have a solution for you! There is an incredibly useful package called kill-port that allows you to kill a process on a given port.

It's super easy to use. All you have to do is run the following command:

```bash
npx kill-port 5000
```

That's it! Now you can start your service on port 5000.

## Wait... What if I want to see which process is running on that port before terminating it? ðŸ¤”

Dude, relax... If you want to see which process is running before you terminate it, you can run the following command:

I just thought that you already knew that, but here you go:

**MacOS**

```bash
lsof -i :5000
```

**Windows**

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
```
