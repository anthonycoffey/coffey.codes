### Introduction

As a veteran Full Stack Engineer with over 10 years of experience, I have had the privilege of working with hundreds of clients as both a freelancer and an employee, honing my skills in the JavaScript, PHP, and Python ecosystems. My journey began on the LAMP stack, where I crafted web applications and WordPress sites. In 2017, I pivoted my focus exclusively towards JavaScript and Python, seeking to deepen my expertise in these dynamic languages.

Throughout my career, I've not only developed software but also contributed to the open-source community, as
evidenced by my node package,
[react-native-expo-authorize-net](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-expo-authorize-net). My passion for
collaboration and my ability to design solutions for complex problems has been the driving force behind my
success in transforming ideas into market-ready software solutions across startups and enterprises.

I am eager to bring my rich blend of experience and enthusiasm for innovation to your team, and I would greatly
appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I could help! Let's chat!
