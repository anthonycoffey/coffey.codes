### Introduction

As a Software Engineer with over ten years of professional experience, I bring a wealth of experience with a creative edge to the table inspired by my involvement with the Austin, Texas art community as an artist/musician.

Since 2012, I have worked with hundreds of clients to develop and maintain custom software solutions designed to meet their unique needs. I specialize in JavaScript and Python ecosystems, and I have a wealth of experience in web/mobile development, cloud infrastructure management and search engine marketing/optimization.

My commitment to the open-source community is demonstrated through projects like my node package, [react-native-expo-authorize-net](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-expo-authorize-net).

In 2024, I am particularly passionate about leveraging AI and machine learning to create practical solutions that empower small businesses. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can bring my expertise to your team and help however I can!

Thanks in advance for your consideration, let's chat soon about how I can help!
