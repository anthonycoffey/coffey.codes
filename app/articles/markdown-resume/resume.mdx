### Introduction

Over the last decade, I have refined my skills in business strategy, project management, cloud computing, software engineering, and digital marketing working with clients across a wide range of industries including heavily regulated sectors like healthcare, fintech, and insurance.

This rich blend of experiences has not only sharpened my technical proficiency but also my interpersonal skills, establishing me as an energetic extrovert and a reliable team collaborator.

My commitment to the open-source community is demonstrated through my involvement with online developer communities and projects like my node package, [react-native-expo-authorize-net](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-expo-authorize-net).

I am passionate about leveraging AI/ML to create practical, accessible solutions that empower people by solving problems with technology in a meaningful way.

I bring a wealth of experience to the table that extends well beyond just writing code, and I look forward to getting the opportunity to discuss how I can help!
