### Introduction

Over the last decade, I have honed my skills in business strategy, project management, cloud computing, software engineering, and digital marketing working with clients across a wide range of industries including heavily regulated sectors like healthcare, fintech, and insurance.

Since 2014, I have worked with hundreds of clients to develop and maintain custom software solutions designed to meet their unique needs. This rich blend of experiences
has not only sharpened my technical proficiency but also refined my interpersonal skills, establishing me as an energetic extrovert and a reliable team collaborator.

My commitment to the open-source community is demonstrated through projects like my node package, [react-native-expo-authorize-net](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-expo-authorize-net).

Moving forward in 2024 and beyond, I am passionate about leveraging AI to create practical, accessible solutions that empower small business and individuals by solving problems with technology in a meaningful way.

Thanks in advance for the consideration! I bring a wealth of experience to the table that extends well beyond just writing code, and I look forward to getting the opportunity to discuss how I can help!
