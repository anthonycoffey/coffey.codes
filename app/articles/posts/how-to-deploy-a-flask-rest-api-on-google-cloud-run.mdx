Deploying a Flask REST API to Google Cloud Run allows you to run your application in a fully managed serverless environment. This guide will walk you through deploying a Flask API from a source directory using the gcloud command-line tool.

### Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have the following:
- Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated

### Setting Up the Flask API

You can setup the Flask API however you like, and in the root directory create a Dockerfile and requirements.txt file

```
api/
│-- app/              # Flask application directory
│-- Dockerfile        # Containerization instructions
│-- requirements.txt  # Python Dependencies
```

### Understanding the Dockerfile

The Dockerfile defines how the application is containerized:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

# OPTIONAL - Install additional packages required by dependencies listed in requirements.tx
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package-name-here

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8080

COPY . /app

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "--workers", "2", "--threads", "8", "app:create_app()"]
```

This sets up a minimal Python environment, installs dependencies, exposes port 8080, and runs the API using Gunicorn.

Notice the `apt-get install` command. This is optional and should only be used to install any additional packages required by dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Deploying to Google Cloud Run

1. Navigate to the API directory:
    ```
    cd api
    ```
2. Deploy the API using Google Cloud Run:

    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy flask-api --source ./ --region us-central1 --platform managed --allow-unauthenticated
    ```

    This command does the following:
    - Deploys the API from the current directory
    - Sets the region to us-central1
    - Uses the managed Cloud Run platform
    - Allows unauthenticated access (optional, depends on your security needs)

3. **Wait for the deployment to complete.** Google Cloud Run will provide a public URL upon success.

4. Test the API:
    ```bash
    curl https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL/hello-world
    ```
Simply replace `YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL` with the actual URL provided after deployment and substitute `hello-world` with the specific API endpoint you are testing.

### Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

#### Gunicorn Command Issues

One common issue is getting the Gunicorn command to correctly call the Flask application. The CMD in the Dockerfile is defined as:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "--workers", "2", "--threads", "8", "app:create_app()"]
```

However, the `app:create_app()` command may vary based on your file structure and function name. If your application is organized differently, you might need to modify this command.

For example, if your app instance is directly in app.py, use:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "app:app"]
```

If your factory function is named differently, adjust accordingly:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "myapp:create_app()"]
```

If you are having issues after deploying, check your Flask application's entry point to ensure Gunicorn can locate and run it properly.

Use `gcloud functions logs read` to view logs for debugging, or navigate to the Cloud Run service in the Google Cloud Console to view the logs for your service.

### Conclusion

Deploying a Flask API to Google Cloud Run is simple with the `gcloud run deploy` command. For a production-ready setup, consider setting the minimum instance to 1 to avoid cold starts and optimize performance.
