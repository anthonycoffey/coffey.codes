Sometimes when working in Node environments, console logging objects doesn't provide the information you'd expect. That may be due to nested object structures, and one way I like to make
sure I'm not hallucinating is by using a helper function to log the nested data... just to be sure. ðŸ˜’

Import the following module into your code and you'll be able to `logNestedObjects` and see any "hidden" information that is stashed away in your response object.

```javascript
export function logNestedObjects(variable: any, depth = 0) {
    const indent = '  '.repeat(depth); // Adjust the indentation level

    if (typeof variable === 'object' && variable !== null) {
        console.log(indent + '{');
        for (const key in variable) {
            console.log(indent + `  ${key}:`);
            logNestedObjects(variable[key], depth + 2); // Recursively log nested objects
        }
        console.log(indent + '}');
    } else {
        console.log(indent + variable);
    }
}
```
