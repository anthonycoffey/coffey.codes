summary: 'Applying to jobs can be a daunting task, but with a well-organized resume you can make a great first impression! I'm ditching tired designs and going minimal with a Markdown resume, here's how I did it!'
---

Over the last decade, I have refined my expertise in business strategy, project management, cloud computing, software engineering, and digital marketing. My technical and interpersonal skills have established me as an energetic and reliable team player with a diverse background and a successful track record.

I am the owner and maintainer of a RN Native Module, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-expo-authorize-net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-native-expo-authorize-net</a>, and I am very passionate about creating practical solutions that solve real problems.

My expertise extends well beyond writing code and I would love an opportunity to discuss any roles that I would be a good fit for. Thanks in advance for the consideration, have a great week!
