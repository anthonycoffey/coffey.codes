# LinkedIn Ad Creatives (Examples)

This document provides example ad copy frameworks for LinkedIn campaigns, based on the `marketing-advertising-strategy.md` (Section VIII) and targeting the defined Ideal Client Profiles (ICPs). These should be tested and refined based on performance data tracked in `tracking.md`.

## Core Principles for LinkedIn Ads

*   **Targeting:** Leverage LinkedIn's precise targeting (Job Title, Industry, Company Size, Skills) to reach decision-makers within ICPs.
*   **Professional Tone:** Maintain a professional and value-driven tone suitable for the platform.
*   **Highlight Experience:** Consistently mention the 12 years of experience to build credibility.
*   **Focus on Solutions:** Translate technical skills into business benefits (reliability, scalability, efficiency, innovation).
*   **Address Pain Points:** Speak directly to the challenges of each ICP.
*   **Clear UVP:** Incorporate elements of the Unique Value Proposition (from `uvp.md`).
*   **Strong CTA:** Use clear calls-to-action relevant to the ad goal (e.g., Learn More, Request Consultation, Visit Website, Download).
*   **Visuals:** Use high-quality, professional images. Options include: a professional headshot, clean abstract graphics representing technology/data/networks, or simple illustrations related to the service (e.g., code snippets, flowcharts). Avoid generic stock photos. Ensure visuals align with the professional brand aesthetic.
*   **Landing Page Alignment (CRITICAL):** Ensure the ad's landing page (e.g., service page, case study, contact page) directly matches the ad's message, promise, and CTA. A mismatch kills conversions.
