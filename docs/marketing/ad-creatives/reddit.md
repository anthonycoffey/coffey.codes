# Reddit Ad Creatives (Examples)

This document provides example ad copy frameworks for Reddit campaigns, based on the `marketing-advertising-strategy.md` (Section VIII & VII.C). Reddit requires a different approach than LinkedIn, focusing on relevance to specific subreddits and offering clear value, as users can be skeptical of overt advertising.

## Core Principles for Reddit Ads

*   **Subreddit Targeting:** Target specific, relevant subreddits where ICPs or technical influencers might be active (e.g., r/webdev, r/node, r/Python, r/reactjs, r/MachineLearning, r/smallbusiness, r/Austin).
*   **Authenticity & Value:** Ads should feel less corporate and more direct. Offer clear value or solutions relevant to the subreddit's context. Avoid excessive marketing jargon.
*   **Conciseness:** Get straight to the point. Headlines and body copy should be clear and concise.
*   **Highlight Experience/Credibility:** Mentioning the 12 years of experience can still be valuable for differentiation.
*   **Clear CTA:** Tell users what to do (Visit Website, Send Message/DM, Learn More).
*   **Visuals:** Simple, relevant images or no image (text ads). Avoid overly polished marketing graphics. Memes *can* work if highly relevant to the sub, but use with extreme caution.
*   **Landing Page Alignment (CRITICAL):** Ensure the linked page directly matches the ad's promise and CTA. A mismatch will be poorly received.
*   **Monitor & Engage (Important):** Consider monitoring relevant subreddits *before* advertising to understand norms. Be prepared to potentially (though not required) engage respectfully with comments on ads, reinforcing authenticity.

## Ad Examples: Targeting Technical Subreddits (e.g., r/node, r/Python, r/webdev)

*   **Target Audience:** Developers, technical leads, potentially founders in technical subreddits (overlaps with ICP 1 & 2 decision-influencers).

## Ad Examples: Targeting Business/Local Subreddits (e.g., r/smallbusiness, r/Austin)

## Testing & Optimization

*   **Subreddit Performance:** Monitor which subreddits drive clicks and, more importantly, relevant inquiries (track via CRM).
*   **Headline/Body Variations:** Test different angles â€“ skill focus vs. problem/solution focus.
*   **CTA Effectiveness:** See if "Learn More" vs. "Send Message" vs. "Contact Me" performs differently in various subreddits.
*   **Monitor Comments:** Be prepared to engage respectfully with comments if they arise (though not guaranteed on ads).
*   **Budget Allocation:** Shift budget towards subreddits and ad variations that yield qualified leads. Start with very small daily budgets per subreddit.
