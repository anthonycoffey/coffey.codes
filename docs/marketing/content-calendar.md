# Marketing Content Calendar (Initial Draft)

This document outlines a starting content calendar, focusing primarily on blog posts for `coffey.codes` as described in the `marketing-advertising-strategy.md` and `roadmap.md`. The goal is to establish thought leadership, attract organic traffic (SEO), and provide value to Ideal Client Profiles (ICPs).

**Process Notes:**
*   **Keyword Research:** Before finalizing titles and angles, perform keyword research (using tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs/SEMrush free tiers, or manual SERP analysis) to identify relevant terms ICPs are searching for. Integrate these keywords naturally into content.
*   **Audit Existing Posts:** Review existing posts in `app/articles/posts/` against these themes and ICPs. Identify posts that can be updated, repurposed, or identify gaps that new content should fill. Prioritize updating high-potential existing content alongside creating new posts.

## Content Themes

*   **Web/Mobile Development Best Practices:** Targeting ICP 1 (SMEs needing reliable development). Focus on scalability, maintainability, performance, security, technology choices.
*   **Practical AI Implementation:** Targeting ICP 2 (Businesses exploring AI). Focus on demystifying AI, specific use cases, integration challenges, pragmatic approaches, ROI.
*   **Freelancing/Consulting Insights:** Broader appeal, showcasing professionalism and experience.
*   **Technical Deep Dives:** Demonstrating expertise in specific technologies (Node.js, Python, React, AWS, GCP, etc.).

## Publishing Cadence

*   **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Aim for 2-3 initial posts to launch the blog.
*   **Phase 2 (Months 3-6):** Aim for 1-2 posts per month.
*   **Phase 3 (Months 6+):** Maintain 1-2 posts per month, potentially adding other content formats (e.g., guides, webinars) if resources allow.
