# Formalized Referral Program Strategy

## Rationale

Satisfied clients and professional contacts are often willing to recommend services they trust. A formalized referral program encourages and rewards these recommendations, turning happy clients and network connections into a proactive source of qualified leads. It leverages existing relationships and social proof.

## Objectives

- Generate high-quality leads from trusted sources (existing clients, network partners).
- Increase client acquisition at potentially lower costs compared to other channels.
- Strengthen relationships with existing clients and partners by offering rewards.
- Leverage social proof and word-of-mouth marketing systematically.

## Execution Plan

### 1. Define Program Structure & Incentives

- **Target Audience for Referrals:** Who can refer? (e.g., Current clients, past clients, specific partners, anyone).
- **Incentive for the Referrer:** What does the person making the referral receive?
    - **Options:**
        - Fixed cash bonus upon the referred client signing a contract.
        - Percentage of the first project value.
        - Service credits or discounts on future work.
        - Non-monetary rewards (e.g., donation to their chosen charity).
    - **Timing:** When is the reward paid? (e.g., upon signed contract, upon first payment).
- **Incentive for the Referred Client (Optional):** Does the new client receive anything for being referred?
    - **Options:** Discount on their first project, extended support period.
- **Clarity:** Ensure the terms are simple, clear, and easy to understand.

### 2. Communication & Promotion

- **Inform Existing Clients:** Directly inform current and past clients about the program via email or during project wrap-up conversations.
- **Website Information (Optional):** Create a simple page or section on coffey.codes explaining the program.
- **Email Signature:** Include a brief mention or link in your email signature.
- **Networking:** Mention the program when appropriate in networking conversations.

### 3. Tracking & Management

- **Mechanism:** How will referrals be tracked?
    - **Manual:** Ask new leads "How did you hear about us?". If referred, ask for the referrer's name. Keep track in a spreadsheet or CRM.
    - **Referral Codes (More Complex):** Assign unique codes to referrers (requires more setup).
    - **Dedicated Form Field:** Add an optional "Referred By" field to the contact form.
- **Process:** Define the internal process for verifying a referral and disbursing the reward.

### 4. Legal & Ethical Considerations

- **Transparency:** Be transparent about the program terms.
- **Compliance:** Ensure the program complies with any relevant regulations.
- **Authenticity:** Encourage genuine referrals, not just reward-chasing.

## Measurement

- **Key Metrics:**
    - Number of referrals received.
    - Conversion rate of referred leads to clients.
    - Cost per acquisition via referrals (compared to other channels).
    - Participation rate among eligible referrers.
- **Review:** Periodically assess the program's effectiveness and adjust incentives or processes as needed.

## Next Steps

- Finalize the specific incentives for referrers (and potentially referred clients).
- Draft communication materials (email templates, website text if applicable).
- Set up the tracking mechanism (e.g., spreadsheet template, CRM update).
- Begin communicating the program to the initial target group (e.g., current clients).
