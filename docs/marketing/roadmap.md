# Marketing Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to implementing the marketing and advertising strategy defined in `marketing-advertising-strategy.md`. It incorporates the foundational website optimization phase (Phase 0) discussed during planning.

## Phase 0 (Months 0-1): Foundational Website & Profile Optimization

*Goal: Ensure the primary online presence (website, LinkedIn) effectively communicates value and captures interest.*

*   **Website - UVP & Services:**
    *   Clearly state the UVP (from `uvp.md`) on the homepage.
    *   Create/refine dedicated service pages for Web/Mobile Development and AI Consulting, detailing offerings, processes, and benefits.
    *   Ensure clear distinction between the two service categories.
*   **Website - Trust & Conversion:**
    *   Add initial trust signals: Request and display 1-2 client testimonials. Add logos if permission granted.
    *   Implement clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs) across the site (e.g., "Schedule a Strategy Call," "Discuss Your Project," "Contact Us"). Link CTAs to the contact page or a booking system.
    *   Ensure the contact form (`components/ContactForm.tsx`) is functional (**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY:** Requires backend implementation - see `progress.md` - must be completed before relying on form for lead capture).
*   **Website - Content Foundation:**
    *   Develop 1-2 detailed case studies showcasing successful projects relevant to ICPs. Publish on the website.
*   **LinkedIn Profile Optimization:**
    *   Update LinkedIn profile headline and summary to reflect the UVP and service focus (Web/Mobile + Pragmatic AI).
    *   Ensure experience section details relevant projects and skills.
*   **Analytics & Tracking Setup:**
    *   Configure Google Analytics (GA4) with goal tracking for key conversions (e.g., contact form submissions).
    *   Set up a basic lead tracking system (CRM or spreadsheet) to log inquiries and sources.
    *   Install LinkedIn Insight Tag on `coffey.codes`.
*   **Phase Completion Check:** Verify all Phase 0 items are complete before proceeding.

## Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Initial Content & Organic Growth

*Goal: Start building authority, engage networks, and test initial paid advertising.*
***Prerequisite:** Successful completion of all Phase 0 Foundational items.*

*   **Content Creation:**
    *   Launch blog on `coffey.codes`.
    *   Publish 2-3 initial blog posts targeting ICP pain points or relevant technical topics (reference `content-calendar.md`).
    *   Publish the case studies developed in Phase 0.
*   **Organic Networking:**
    *   Begin active, consistent engagement on LinkedIn: Share blog posts, relevant third-party content, connect strategically with potential clients/partners in target industries.
    *   Identify and participate authentically in 1-2 relevant online communities (e.g., specific subreddits, Slack groups) or local Austin tech groups. Focus on providing value.
*   **Initial Ad Testing (LinkedIn):**
    *   Launch a small, highly targeted LinkedIn Ad campaign (Budget: ~$300-$500/month).
    *   Focus on *one* ICP initially (e.g., ICP1 for Web/Mobile or ICP2 for AI).
    *   Test 2-3 different ad creatives/messaging angles based on `ad-creatives/linkedin.md`.
    *   Direct traffic to relevant service pages or case studies.
    *   Monitor results closely using `tracking.md` framework (CTR, Clicks, Leads, CPL).
*   **Phase Completion Check:** Review KPIs against `tracking.md`, analyze performance, and adjust next phase priorities/budget accordingly.

## Phase 2 (Months 3-6): Scaling Content & Refining Ads

*Goal: Expand reach, optimize advertising based on data, and generate consistent leads.*

*   **Expand Content:**
    *   Continue regular blogging (1-2 posts/month) based on `content-calendar.md`.
    *   Develop additional case studies as relevant projects complete.
    *   Consider creating a downloadable lead magnet (e.g., "AI Readiness Checklist," "Guide to Modernizing Legacy Systems") gated behind an email signup form to build an email list.
*   **Refine Advertising (LinkedIn):**
    *   Analyze data from initial LinkedIn Ad tests (Phase 1).
    *   Optimize targeting (job titles, industries, company size), messaging, and bids based on performance (which ads generate qualified leads at acceptable CPL?).
    *   Gradually increase budget *only if* ROI is positive and lead quality is high.
    *   Test different CTAs and landing pages.
*   **Explore Secondary Channels (Optional):**
    *   *If* LinkedIn shows strong positive ROI and budget allows:
        *   Consider testing Reddit Ads for niche technical reach (see `ad-creatives/reddit.md`). Target specific relevant subreddits. Monitor closely.
        *   Consider YouTube Ads for brand awareness/thought leadership *if* high-quality video content can be produced efficiently.
*   **Phase Completion Check:** Review KPIs against `tracking.md`, analyze performance, and adjust next phase priorities/budget accordingly.

## Phase 3 (Months 6+): Optimization & Partnerships

*Goal: Sustain lead flow, optimize for efficiency, and leverage partnerships.*

*   **Ongoing Optimization:**
    *   Continuously monitor KPIs via `tracking.md`.
    *   Regularly A/B test ad copy, landing pages, website CTAs.
    *   Stay informed on market trends (especially AI) and adapt strategy/messaging.
    *   Refine ICP definitions and UVP based on real client interactions and feedback.
*   **Partnership Outreach:**
    *   Begin identifying potential strategic partners (design agencies, marketing firms, non-competing consultants).
    *   Initiate outreach to explore referral relationships or joint value propositions.
*   **Content Maintenance:**
    *   Keep blog content updated.
    *   Refresh case studies periodically.

## Budget & Time Considerations

*   **Advertising:** Start small (~$300-500/month), scale based *only* on proven positive ROI and lead quality.
*   **Tools:** Potential costs for CRM, SEO tools (optional).
*   **Time:** Significant ongoing time investment required for content creation, networking, ad management, and analysis. Factor this into workload.
