# Active Context

*This file tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and project insights. It's the most frequently updated file.*

## Current Focus

The primary focus is on content creation, specifically writing new blog articles. The last major feature development involved implementing taxonomy (categories/tags) and search functionality.

## Recent Changes

*(Summarize the most recent significant updates or commits.)*
- *(Date/Commit ID):* Implementation of taxonomy and search features. (Needs specific commit details if available)

## Immediate Next Steps

2. Potentially define and implement contact form backend handling.
3. Populate remaining Memory Bank details as needed.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Consideration 1:** (e.g., Choosing between library A or B)
- **Decision Point 1:** (e.g., Finalizing API endpoint structure)

## Important Patterns & Preferences

*(Note any specific coding patterns, style preferences, or conventions relevant to the current work that might not be in systemPatterns.md yet.)*
- (e.g., Preference for functional components, specific naming conventions for variables)

## Learnings & Insights

*(Capture any new learnings, discoveries, or insights gained during the recent work.)*
- (e.g., Realization about a library's limitation, a better way to structure a component)
