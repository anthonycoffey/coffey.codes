# Project Progress

*This file tracks the overall status of the project, what works, what's left, known issues, and the evolution of decisions.*

## Current Status

The project appears to be actively in development but substantially built out. Core sections like the blog, portfolio, and contact page exist. Key features like article search and MDX rendering are implemented. It's likely functional but may require content updates, refinement, and potentially deployment setup.

## What Works

*(Based on file structure inference)*
- **Routing:** Next.js App Router structure is in place for major sections (Home, Articles, Portfolio, Case Studies, Contact).
- **Blog:**
    - MDX post rendering (`app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`, `components/mdx.tsx`).
    - Article listing (`app/articles/page.tsx`, `components/posts.tsx`).
    - Category and Tag pages (`app/articles/category/[category]/page.tsx`, `app/articles/tag/[tag]/page.tsx`).
    - Article Search API (`app/api/search/route.ts`) and UI (`components/SearchBox.tsx`, `app/articles/search/page.tsx`).
    - RSS Feed (`app/rss/route.ts`).
- **Portfolio/Case Studies:** Sections exist (`app/portfolio/`, `app/case-studies/`). Content structure seems present (e.g., `public/portfolio/`, `public/case-studies/`).
- **Contact:** Contact page (`app/contact/page.tsx`) and form component (`components/ContactForm.tsx`) exist. (Backend handling TBD).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and SASS are set up.
- **Components:** A library of reusable components exists in `components/`.
- **SEO Basics:** `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, `og/route.tsx` suggest basic SEO considerations.
- **3D Elements:** Integration with React Three Fiber (`components/ThreeScene.tsx`).

## What's Left to Build

*(Potential areas based on inference and common project needs)*
- **Content Population:** Ensure all portfolio items, case studies, and potentially resume details are up-to-date. Write new articles.
- **Contact Form Backend:** The handling mechanism is currently undefined. Needs implementation or clarification.
- **Testing:** No testing strategy is currently planned or implemented.
- **Deployment:** Setup on Vercel is complete, auto-deploying from `master`.
- **Refinement:** Ongoing UI/UX polishing, performance optimization, accessibility checks.
- **Cross-browser Testing:** Verify appearance and functionality across different browsers.
- **Documentation:** Fill in remaining Memory Bank details, add component documentation if needed.
- **Confirmation of Inferred Items:** Verify assumptions (e.g., social links in footer, specific functionality of components like `ThreeScene`).

## Known Issues / Bugs

*(To be identified through testing or user feedback)*
- None reported currently.

## Evolution of Decisions

*(To be documented as the project progresses)*
- *(Initial):* Project likely started or migrated to Next.js App Router.
- *(Initial):* Chose MDX for blog content flexibility.
- *(Initial):* Adopted Tailwind CSS for styling.
