## What Works

_(Based on file structure inference)_

- **Routing:** Next.js App Router structure is in place for major sections (Home, Articles, Portfolio, Case Studies, Contact).
- **Blog:**
  - MDX post rendering (`app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`, `components/mdx.tsx`).
  - Article listing (`app/articles/page.tsx`, `components/posts.tsx`).
  - Category and Tag pages (`app/articles/category/[category]/page.tsx`, `app/articles/tag/[tag]/page.tsx`).
  - Article Search API (`app/api/search/route.ts`) and UI (`components/SearchBox.tsx`, `app/articles/search/page.tsx`).
  - RSS Feed (`app/rss/route.ts`).
- **Portfolio/Case Studies:** Sections exist (`app/portfolio/`, `app/case-studies/`). Content structure seems present (e.g., `public/portfolio/`, `public/case-studies/`).
- **Contact:** Contact page (`app/contact/page.tsx`) and form component (`components/ContactForm.tsx`) exist. (Backend handling ).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and SASS are set up.
- **SEO Basics:** `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, `og/route.tsx` suggest basic SEO considerations.
- **3D Elements:** Integration with React Three Fiber (`components/ThreeScene.tsx`).

## What's Left to Build

_(Potential areas based on inference and common project needs)_

- Potenti\*l areaC basontentinfepulc\*\* Enseommpo projecr netositems, case studies, and potentially resume details are up-to-date. Write new articles.

- **Deployment:** Setup on Vercel is complete, auto-deploying from `master`.
- **Refinement:** Ongoing UI/UX polishing, performance optimization, accessibility checks.
- **Cross-browser Testing:** Verify appearance and functionality across different browsers.
- **Documentation:** Fill in remaining Memory Bank details, add component documentation if needed.
- **Confirmation of Inferred Items:** Verify assumptions (e.g., social links in footer, specific functionality of components like `ThreeScene`).
